####ManchuDecisions
#Reduced number of required provinces to form Manchu from 20 to 18, might reduce it further if Manchu keeps failing to show up.
#No longer needs a random border province in Mongolia (723, Xilin Gol) to form Qing.
#Forming Qing gives 300 of each mana type to help it catch up in tech.
####JapaneseNation
#Japan now gets a unique government type (United Shogunate) upon uniting the country.
####RussianNation
#Now gives Russia 300 of each mana to help it catch up in tech.
####TheCommonwealth
#No longer requires Danzig and Marienburg to form it.
####ME_France_Decisions.txt
#Fixed FRA_centralize_france_decision, which had a Trigger instead of an Allow. This allowed it to be taken at all times.
#Also requires ADM tech 20. You can unlock the government reform by following a mission anyway.
