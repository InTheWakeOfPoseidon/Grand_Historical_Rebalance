#Eunuchs
#Reduced the national unrest modifier from unhappy eunuchs to what's normal among estates, which is +2. The +4 unrest makes sense in vanilla, but in my mod, with responsible blobbing mod enabled, Ming effectively has +4 national unrest most of the time due to always being near the governing capacity. A lot of the problems Paradox added to Ming (constant high unrest, constant high corruption rate) are already built into the responsible blobbing mod, and while it makes sense to make these problems a bit worse for Ming, combining responsible blobbing with Domination's changes to Ming without nerfing either makes AI ming collapse instantly.
