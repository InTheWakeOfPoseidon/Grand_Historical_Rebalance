#Feudalism: Identical spread to vanilla.
#Every institution after feudalism and before enlightenment: Spread halvened.
#Enlightenment: Spread quartered.
#Industrialization: Spread reduced to 10%. Manufactory spread bonuses removed entirely except for Coal/Furnace. A lot of the remaining bonuses changed to require 40 development in the province. A few nerfed even further.
